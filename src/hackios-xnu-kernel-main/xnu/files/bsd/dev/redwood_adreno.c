/*
 * The GPU of the POCO X5 Pro (redwood), an Adreno 642L, woken step by step up to a picture that
 * it fills and the panel shows. Every address below belongs to this phone, and nothing here is
 * touched unless a boot-arg asks for it.
 *
 * Boot-arg gpu=1, on the phone and with the GPU's firmware in the small image: the GPU is
 * started while the system starts and kept for the window server to draw with (the service
 * RedwoodGPU; "the GPU kept on" below). Should a step fail, one line says which, and the system
 * draws in software as it does without the boot-arg.
 *
 * The steps are how this was found out, and they stay for looking: how much of the GPU a kernel
 * under Qualcomm's hypervisor may reach was not known, and an access the hypervisor does not
 * like ends the run, at once or a quarter of a minute later, and often without a word. adreno=N
 * performs steps 1 to N and stops; a step says what it is about to touch before it touches it
 * and what it found after, reads come before writes, and a step that does not find what it
 * needs ends the sequence instead of going on blind.
 *
 *   1  reads   what feeds the GPU from outside: its clocks in the global clock controller, and
 *              the names RPMh knows its supplies by
 *   2  reads   the fuses that say which GPU this is
 *   3  reads   the GPU's own clock controller, as the boot loader left it
 *   4  writes  the "CX" power switch on: the half of the GPU block that is not the 3D core --
 *              the power management processor ("GMU"), the bus interface, the GPU's SMMU
 *   5  writes  the clocks of that half on, and measures with the SoC's frequency counter whether
 *              they run: the control register of one of them does not say
 *   6  reads   the first words from the GPU block itself: registers of the GMU (among them a
 *              counter that should be seen counting) and of the bus interface
 *   7  reads   the GMU's own channel to RPMh
 *   8  reads   the SMMU in front of the GPU: its ID registers, and which stream goes where
 *   9  reads   that SMMU's first translation context
 *  10  writes  two words into the GMU's memory and reads them back: the way its firmware goes
 *  11  asks    TrustZone questions that pass no memory: whether it takes calls from this kernel,
 *              and which firmware images it says it authenticates
 *  12  asks    TrustZone to check the signature of the GPU's "zap shader", the signed image
 *              without which the 3D core stays locked in secure mode: its header goes from the
 *              small image (fw/a660_zap.mdt; fw/a650_zap.mdt on the K40) into memory of ours
 *              that TrustZone is pointed at
 *  13  writes  page tables for the memory the GMU's firmware asks for, and the SMMU: a
 *              translation context with those tables, and the GMU's requests sent through it
 *  14  writes  the GMU's firmware (fw/a660_gmu.bin; a650_gmu.bin on the K40) into its own
 *              memory and into that memory
 *  15  writes  the GMU's configuration, and lets its processor out of reset: the firmware runs
 *  16  writes  the GMU's connection to RPMh; starts its message queues ("HFI")
 *  17  talks   to the GMU: the tables it needs, and the request to power the 3D core, whose
 *              registers are then read
 *  18  writes  the 3D core's translation context, with its ring and its microcode
 *              (fw/a660_sqe.fw, fw/a650_sqe.fw) in it
 *  19  asks    TrustZone to load the zap shader (and first to give up the one a kernel before
 *              this one may have left; the stop at the end of a run asks for that too)
 *  20  writes  the 3D core's registers; starts its command processor and gives it its first
 *              command
 *  21  commands the 3D core out of secure mode, and to write a word into a page of ours
 *  22  commands a picture filled with three colours, and shows it on the panel
 * When the steps are over, what they started is stopped again, in reverse, and the CX half
 * switched off: nothing of the GPU block outlives the run (its SMMU contexts point into this
 * kernel's memory), and the next one starts from what the phone's own start leaves.
 *
 * The firmware is the phone's own, from /vendor/firmware of its Android. There is no register that holds the chip ID (0x06030500,
 * "qcom,chipid" in the device tree): the fuses of step 2 are all the hardware says about
 * itself, and the GMU's version is a property of its firmware.
 *
 * More boot-args:
 *   adreno_only=K      step K alone (what steps 6 to 10 need, they check for themselves: within
 *                      one session of the loader, power and clocks stay as an earlier run left them)
 *   adreno_skip=MASK   leave out the steps whose bits are set (bit 2 = step 2)
 *   adreno_pause=MS    how long the newest step waits after announcing a group of accesses
 *                      (default 2200). The loader, watching from another core (bootcpu=N), writes
 *                      the end of our log to storage every two seconds, and after a silent reset
 *                      that note is all there is.
 *   adreno_fine=1      the newest step waits like that before every single access
 *   adreno_keep=1      with adreno=21: the GPU is not stopped again but kept for the system to draw
 *                      with, through the service RedwoodGPU (see "the GPU kept on" below); it is
 *                      given back when the run ends (adreno_dirty=1: left as a panic leaves it)
 *   adreno_soc=NAME    which SoC's GPU this is: "a660" (redwood, the default) or "a650" (alioth,
 *                      the Redmi K40). What differs between them is in struct adreno_soc below;
 *                      without this the driver is the redwood's, as it always was.
 *   adreno_speed=N     step 17 asks the GMU for the 3D core's Nth speed. a660: 1 315 MHz, 2 450,
 *                      3 550 (the default, the most that GPU is rated for). a650: 1 305, 2 400,
 *                      3 441.6, 4 490, 5 525 (the default: the fastest speed of the slowest of
 *                      the K40's speed bins, so no bin is asked for more than it is fused for),
 *                      6 587 and 7 670
 *   adreno_zap_mem=ADDR  where the device tree reserves the two pages for the zap shader
 *                      (reserved-memory gpu_micro_code@...). Both rows know their own now
 *                      (a660 0x8b71a000, a650 0x8681a000: the alioth's reserved-memory
 *                      pil_gpu_region); this overrides the row.
 *   adreno_blind=1     step 20 starts the command processor with its microcode nowhere, and
 *   adreno_stream1=N   step 18 leaves the core's second stream out (0) or gives it an empty
 *                      context of its own (2): what the SMMU then records shows what the core
 *                      asks for. With 0 and the microcode in place the phone resets.
 *   adreno_direct=1    step 18 gives the core its ring and microcode in one piece each, at their
 *                      physical addresses, and has the SMMU pass the core's stream through
 *                      untouched (bypass): what the core asks for cannot then be refused by the
 *                      SMMU, which tells whether the end at step 20 comes from there or not
 *   adreno_sptprac=1   step 20 first powers the shader/texture processors' own domain the way the
 *                      vendor's a6xx_gmu_sptprac_enable() does (GMU_GX_SPTPRAC_POWER_CONTROL)
 *   adreno_sqe=N       step 20 writes N (default 1) into CP_SQE_CNTL: 1 starts the command
 *                      processor, 0 is the control that only writes the register
 *   adreno_oob=1       step 20 first makes Linux's handshake with the GMU (GMU_OOB_GPU_SET: the
 *                      GMU leaves the GPU's power alone until the command processor runs), 2 with
 *                      the older interrupt bits
 *   adreno_rptr=1      step 20 gives the core's read pointer a page of ours and leaves CP_RB_CNTL's
 *                      "write nothing back" bit clear, as the vendor does for a GPU with APRIV
 *   adreno_zap_first=1 step 19 (the zap shader) is performed before step 17, before the 3D core
 *                      is powered, instead of after everything
 *   adreno_watch=S     after the last step, say once a second for S seconds (default 20) that
 *                      the machine is still alive, and what was written last
 *   adreno_return=1    when all is over, go back to the loader instead of starting the system
 *   display_probe=1    before any step: read what the firmware left the display controller
 *                      doing (display_probe() below; two clocks are turned on, nothing else written)
 * The system does not go on starting until all of this is over, so that the end of the log is
 * ours; the touch screen driver's start would talk across it (leave touchscreen=1 out).
 *
 * Addresses are from the phone's own device tree ("dt:" below; the nodes qcom,kgsl-3d0@3d00000,
 * qcom,gmu@3d69000, clock-controller@3d90000, qcom,gdsc@3d9106c, kgsl-smmu@3da0000,
 * qfprom@780000), register layouts from Linux, where SC7280 is this SoC: drivers/clk/qcom/
 * {gcc,gpucc}-sc7280.c, gdsc.c, clk-rcg2.c, drivers/gpu/drm/msm/adreno/a6xx_gmu.c with
 * registers/adreno/a6xx{,_gmu}.xml, drivers/iommu/arm/arm-smmu/arm-smmu.h, drivers/soc/qcom/
 * cmd-db.c, drivers/firmware/qcom/qcom_scm{,-smc}.c, drivers/soc/qcom/mdt_loader.c. The phone's
 * vendor kernel agrees on every offset used here, and is the only source for the frequency counter.
 *
 * The Redmi K40 (alioth, SM8250-AC, Adreno 650) is the same GPU family and the same layout: its
 * device tree puts every block at the same address (kgsl-3d0@3d00000, gmu@3d6a000, gpucc@3d90000,
 * smmu@3da0000, rscc@3de0000), its GPUCC and GCC clocks have the same offsets (gpucc-sm8250.c,
 * gcc-sm8250.c), and its SMMU streams are 0 and 5 as here. What is not the same is in struct
 * adreno_soc near the top; adreno_soc=a650 picks that row.

/*
 * This driver is one GPU family: every register offset and every sequence of writes below is
 * shared by all a6xx, and comes from Linux (a6xx_gpu.c, a6xx_gmu.c, a6xx_hfi.c, gpucc-sm8250.c,
 * gcc-sm8250.c -- SM8250 and SC7280 share all of those offsets). Only the handful of things
 * collected here differ between the phones, so the driver was written for the redwood and the
 * Redmi K40's SoC is a second row of numbers, not a second driver.
 *
 * The a650 row is from Linux, from Qualcomm's published device trees, and from the K40's own
 * device tree (Mu-Silicium's alioth.dtb, read without the phone by tools/alioth.py):
 *   - chip id, gmem: a6xx_catalog.c (0x06050002, 1 MB + 128 KB); the alioth's qcom,chipid says the
 *     same 0x06050002
 *   - speed bins and the fuse: sm8250.dtsi (gpu_speed_bin@19b, 3 bits from bit 5). The alioth's
 *     own DT lists all seven frequencies (305/400/441.6/490/525/587/670 MHz) but no qcom,level,
 *     so the RPMh levels come from Linux's OPP table (64/128/144/192/224/256/320); the phone
 *     will say whether that enumeration is its own (the fill-in list in docs/alioth.md)
 *   - cp_lpac_fifo / cp_chicken_dbg / bicubic weights / PC_DBG_ECO: a6xx_gpu.c's per-family
 *     tests: a650 has no LPAC fifo and no CP_CHICKEN_DBG (those are a660's), it does have the
 *     BICUBIC weights, and its PC_DBG_ECO_CNTL is 0x00300200 (a660 shares that value)
 *   - UBWC: a6xx_set_ubwc_config for the a650 family, highest bank bit 16 (the K40's LPDDR5)
 *   - zap memory: reserved-memory pil_gpu_region@8681a000 of the alioth's device tree -- the
 *     same node the redwood calls gpu_micro_code

 * PDC's microcode and command slots, so Linux skips all of that and leaves only two writes, the
 * ones below (a6xx_gmu_rpmh_init: pdc_in_aop, then setup_pdc). What is left to us is those two,
 * and the GMU side's little program (a6xx_load_rsc_ucode): after the firmware has started and
 * before the message queues are.
 *
 * The RSCC program is the a650 family's. The last word of the hidden command is one thing that
 * is not settled by the trees: this kernel ran the redwood (a660) with 0x80000021, while Linux
 * writes 0x80000021 only for the a740 and a722 and 0x80000000 for every other a6xx -- the a650
 * and a660 included. 0x80000021 is kept, because that is what the one phone that draws with this
 * driver used; the K40's step 16 says whether 0x80000000 is what its sequencer wants.

 * told where the image will be -- the two pages the device tree reserves for it
 * (reserved-memory gpu_micro_code@8b71a000, the zap-shader node's memory-region) --, the image's
 * one segment (the file a660_zap.b02, relocatable: at the start of that memory) is put there,
 * and TrustZone is asked to authenticate it and run it. The vendor's driver does this before it
 * starts the 3D core's command processor (a6xx_rb_start: a6xx_microcode_load), Linux after;
 * this phone's own order is kept. Where the SoC's row names no region (the K40: its device tree's
 * pil_gpu_region is outside the memory the loader hands this kernel), two pages are taken from the
 * kernel's own map -- contiguous, aligned, and never given back. Once that is done the memory is
 * TrustZone's, and nothing here can see whether it is so; to write there again would be the end of
 * the run. Our kernels
 * come and go without the phone restarting, so a kernel leaves no zap shader behind: when it
 * gives the GPU back it has TrustZone take the shader away again (gpu_block_stop(); the
 * vendor's driver does the same when it is unloaded: kgsl_zap_shader_unload), and the next one
 * loads it as if the phone had just started. A kernel that did not end in order cannot have
 * done that. So the same request is made here first: TrustZone answers it with success whether
 * it had a shader or not, and hands the memory back cleared (it then reads as zeroes). Should
 * it ever refuse, and then refuse the header or the place too, that is taken to mean that it
 * has a zap shader from before and keeps it: it is used as it is, and nothing is written.
 * (Step 21 is what tells whether the 3D core gets out of secure mode with it.) There was a
 * boot-arg adreno_zap=0 for the second and later runs of a started phone; nothing reads it now.

/*
 * ---- the 3D core's addresses, and who owns them -------------------------------------------
 *
 * There is one address space for everything the 3D core reads and writes: context 0 of the
 * GPU's SMMU, 39 bits of it, three levels of 4K pages, made by step 18 (core_space above).
 * Below GPU_ADDRESSES_START the steps put their own blocks at constants of their own -- the
 * ring at 0x01000000, the microcode at 0x01100000, the scratch page at 0x01200000, the test's
 * target at 0x10000000 -- and those are constants and not allocations: there is one of each
 * for the whole run. From GPU_ADDRESSES_START up the addresses are handed out a buffer at a
 * time by redwood_gpu_address() out of gpu_free, which is this driver's whole allocator: a
 * list of what is not in use, lowest first, first fit, coalesced when given back.
 *
 * That division of labour is Linux's msm, not an invention here. There the kernel picks an
 * address out of a drm_mm when a buffer is first asked about and keeps it in the object until
 * the object goes (msm_gem_get_iova -> get_vma_locked), and userspace only asks:
 * MSM_INFO_GET_IOVA. Mesa's freedreno does exactly that and nothing else -- fd_bo_init_common
 * sets bo->iova from msm_bo_iova(), one GEM_INFO call per buffer -- so the kernel is the
 * allocator for both of this port's consumers and neither of them fights it.
 *
 * One thing to know before anything is built on these addresses: there is one space, so an
 * address is the same memory in every program. That is what makes an argument buffer possible
 * at all -- a buffer of addresses means something wherever it is read -- and it is also why
 * one program's shader can reach another's buffers by naming an address it was never given.
 * Nothing here can check an address a shader computes; only page tables of the client's own
 * could, and there is one context for everybody (space_on() above, context 0).
 *
 * boot-arg gpu_va:
 *   0 (the default)  as it has always been. Addresses packed one allocation after another,
 *                    and VA_START/VA_SIZE not answered.
 *   1                VA_START and VA_SIZE answered, and the space's state printed with the
 *                    other GPU numbers. Not one address changes.
 *   2               ... and a granule of addresses left unmapped after every buffer, so that a
 *                    read or a write that runs off the end of one buffer falls into nothing and
 *                    the SMMU says so with the address (space_faulted()) instead of landing
 *                    silently in whatever buffer was made next. This is for argument buffers
 *                    above all: there the GPU dereferences an address that a program wrote into
 *                    memory, and a wrong address is otherwise indistinguishable from wrong data.
 *                    Every address moves, so it is not the default.
 *
 * Why VA_START and VA_SIZE are behind the arg rather than always answered: in msm they mean
 * "this space is yours to place buffers in", and msm refuses them outright to a client that
 * does not have page tables of its own (adreno_gpu.c, adreno_get_param: -EINVAL when
 * ctx->aspace == gpu->aspace). Here every client is in the one context 0, so the honest
 * default is msm's refusal; with the arg they are answered as what they are here, which is
 * the range the kernel allocates out of -- a number to size a heap or maxBufferLength against,
 * not a licence to place anything. Nothing in Mesa is affected either way: freedreno asks
 * VA_SIZE only at drm version 9 and up (FD_VERSION_VA_SIZE), and tools/mesa/redwood-drm says 1.7.

 * boot-arg gpu_recover=1: the 3D core is put back where step 20 and step 21 left it, and
 * everything it had been given is given up, so that the next submission is its own again.
 * Returns whether that worked; without the boot-arg, false at once and nothing is touched.
 *
 * Why it is worth doing: one submission the core never finishes otherwise costs the rest of the
 * run. gpuWait() (iokit/Kernel/RedwoodGPU.cpp) stops waiting for good after the first such
 * submission, and from then on every wait says at once that the GPU is not done -- so every
 * later submission "succeeds" and writes nothing, which reads like a measurement and is not
 * one. With this, a core that hangs costs one submission.
 *
 * What is done, and who says so (Linux, drivers/gpu/drm/msm/adreno/a6xx_gpu.c unless said
 * otherwise):
 *
 *   - the command processor is halted first, so that nothing more of the ring is fetched while
 *     the rest of this happens (a6xx_recover: "Halt SQE first", cp_sqe_cntl = 3; step 20 starts
 *     it with 1, and bit 0 is what runs it);
 *   - the GMU is told to keep the core powered whatever it makes of what follows (Linux sets
 *     the same word when its hang interrupt is about to look at a core that has stopped:
 *     a6xx_fault_detect_irq. Nothing has set it here, there being no interrupt of ours);
 *   - what the core has under way on the bus is let finish and nothing new is taken
 *     (a6xx_bus_clear_pending_transactions with gx_off, which a6xx_recover calls before it
 *     pulls the reset line: core_bus_halt(true) here, which also halts the core's own side);
 *   - the reset line of the core's own half (GX) is pulled and let go (a6xx_gpu_sw_reset, whose
 *     timings and read in between these are: the line is held for 100 us). Everything that was
 *     wedged is in that half -- the shader cores, the depth and colour pipeline, the caches,
 *     the command processor. The CX half is not reset, so the SMMU keeps its tables and the
 *     core's memory stays where it was mapped; nothing of ours has to be made again;
 *   - the ring is put back to where the core says it reads from, with nothing to read;
 *   - and the core is started again exactly as the steps start it: step 20's registers, its
 *     command processor, "initialize"; then step 21, out of secure mode and a word written to
 *     memory on command, which is that step's own proof that the core does as it is told. The
 *     zap shader stays where TrustZone put it -- Linux does not load it again either
 *     (a6xx_zap_shader_init keeps a flag) and asks the core to leave secure mode after every
 *     reset just the same.
 *
 * Not Linux's, and the reason this is behind a boot-arg: Linux never lets go of that reset line
 * on a part whose GMU runs firmware of its own. a6xx_recover() does the reset only for the a6xx
 * parts whose "GMU" is a wrapper with no firmware; on a part like this one it takes the whole
 * CX half's power away instead and starts from nothing, because its GMU is set up afresh every
 * time the GPU is woken. The one place Linux resets GX on a part with a real GMU is
 * a6xx_gmu_force_off() (a6xx_gmu.c), and there it pulls the line and leaves it pulled -- the CX
 * half is about to lose power anyway. Here the GMU is set up once, by steps 15 to 17, and never
 * spoken to again, so there is nothing of its state that a submission depends on; but whether a
 * GMU that was told none of this goes on believing it owns a core that has just been reset is a
 * question the phone answers, not the sources. So: with the boot-arg left out, none of this
 * runs and a wedge costs the run, exactly as before.
 *
 * Steps 20 and 21 are called as they are rather than copied, so that there is one list of the
 * core's registers and not two. That costs their two cx_ready() calls, which measure the
 * register bus's clock (some 28 ms each) and leave `quiet` false, so the recovery says every
 * register it writes. Once per hang, that is evidence rather than noise.
