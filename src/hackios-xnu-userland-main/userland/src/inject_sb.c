/*
 * libredwood-sb.dylib: code of ours inside SpringBoard (see inject.c for how it gets there).
 *
 *   - The phone is "activated". SpringBoard asks mobileactivationd, which is not running (and
 *     could not talk to Apple anyway); without an answer it treats the device as bricked and
 *     shows the first-boot setup ("hello") instead of the lock screen.
 *   - The setup assistant is never needed, whatever the reason: nobody is going to go through
 *     it here.
 *   - SpringBoard starts a few seconds late where the kernel's boot-args say so (sb_delay=N;
 *     "xl run" does for the phone). /private/var is empty at every boot, so the applications
 *     are registered anew each time, one after another; one that is registered after
 *     SpringBoard has laid out the home screen ends up on a later page, and which one that is
 *     differs from boot to boot. On the phone that happens; under QEMU, where everything takes
 *     five times as long, it does not -- and there the delay is harmful: for a reason not yet
 *     found the window server then never takes our touch screen service for its own.
 *     (A wrapper program in the launchd job would be the obvious way to wait; launchd panics
 *     the system when a system job runs anything that is not Apple's.)
 *   - The picture SpringBoard keeps of an application that leaves the screen (for the application
 *     switcher and the next launch) is saved as JPEG or PNG, not as an ASTC texture: see
 *     snapshot_output_format().
 *   - Where CoreAnimation draws with its software renderer (QEMU; the phone without gpu=1) the
 *     "vibrant" views draw their content as it is: see plain_vibrancy().
 *   - A press of the side button that is long over is not taken for a long press (Siri) because
 *     SpringBoard was busy waking the display: see lock_long_press().
 *   - A long press on the lock screen's wallpaper does not open the poster switcher, which the
 *     window server here shows as a black screen: see poster_switcher_allowed().
 *   - Darwin notifications as a remote control, for scripts (rwtouch notify NAME):
 *       com.redwood.unlock      what the lock screen does after "swipe up to open"
 *       com.redwood.layers      write down the layers SpringBoard has on the screen: see layers()
 *       com.redwood.switcher    open the switcher of running applications: see switcher()
 *     In any other program given this library (INJECT in build.sh) only the last of them is
 *     answered, with that program's layers.

 * PaperBoardUI fills it from the image provider of the wallpaper, and the result is drawn at about
 * fifteen per cent (the layer tree: SBWallpaperEffectView at opacity 0.1497 -> PBUIFakeBlurView ->
 * PBUIWallpaperView -> PBUISnapshotReplicaView -> a UIImageView).
 *
 * Here there is no picture of the wallpaper to put in it. The wallpaper itself is drawn live by
 * PosterBoard, in another process, and hosted into SpringBoard's layer tree; SpringBoard has no
 * bitmap of it, and nothing ever bakes one -- after three and a half minutes of an idle phone
 * /var/mobile/Library holds sixty directories and not one of them is PaperBoard, PosterBoard or
 * Wallpaper. So the provider hands over a placeholder: 846 x 1827 pixels of one colour,
 * (179, 77, 179), which CoreAnimation compresses to ASTC and draws over the two cards on the left
 * at 14.9 per cent. That is what made them purple instead of merely dimmed.
 *
 * The dimming itself is right and stays: two draws of a flat black at 11.4 per cent, which is the
 * shadow one expects to see. Only the wash is left out, because a wash of a colour that is not the
 * wallpaper's is worse than no wash at all. When something here can give PaperBoardUI a real
 * picture of the wallpaper, this hook is what should go -- and until then switcher_wallpaper=1
 * among the boot-args puts it back as iOS asks for it, so that whoever works on the wallpaper can
 * see at once whether their picture arrives, without rebuilding an image to find out.
